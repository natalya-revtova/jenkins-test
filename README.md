# **Application in Go and Continuous Delivery Pipeline as Code**

This project is an example of setting up a continuous delivery pipeline for application in Go (golang).

## **About the application**

This application is a Go Program that implements Huffman Coding Algorithm. A Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The time complexity of the Huffman algorithm is O(nlogn).
